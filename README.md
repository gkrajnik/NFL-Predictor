# NFL-Predicter
In this project, we made a program that predicts the outcomes of NFL regular season games using previous games from the same season, and a point calculation system that takes the previous weeks points and adds them up to compare to the opposing teams total. Then it makes a pie chart and a percent comparison to show who is most likely to win.
